=====================================================================================

This is a design for an augmented breakout for a 74HC595
serial-in/parallel-out 8-bit shift register, in a TSSOP-16 package
(specifically, 74HC595PW), with added N-channel MOSFETs (BSS806N or
similar) in SOT-23 packages, and 5.08mm-pitch output screw terminals.

Features
--------

*   Decoupling capacitor on board.
*   N-channel open-drain outputs: The outputs are not run directly from
    the 74HC595 pins but via an N-channel MOSFET gated by each pin. The
    outputs are thus sink-only but can handle greater voltage and
    current depending on the MOSFETs used.
*   5.08mm-pitch screw terminals for outputs.
*   No terminal is included for a power ground connection. However,
    plated vias are provided at the ends of the board, including a row
    of three at one end suitable for 14AWG wire, and a 3x2 arrangement
    at 0.1in pitch on the other end which can be used for header pins,
    PCB-mount quick-disconnect tabs, or arbitrary other through-hole
    components, or even another screw terminal.
    *   If the corner mounting holes will be used, make sure not to
        install hardware that will obstruct the holes or screw heads.
*   The host-side 6-pin header provides power, serial, and blanking
    inputs to the board, while the compatible guest-side 6-pin header
    provides serial outputs and passed-through power and blanking
    outputs to the host-side header of another breakout (or to another
    74HC595-based or similar assembly).
*   Pre-fab and some-assembly-required options for cables for the header
    connectors are readily available.

Parts list
----------

*   1 x 74HC595PW (TSSOP-16)
*   8 x N-channel MOSFET (SOT-23, pins in GSD order) e.g. BSS806N,
    2N7002P
    *   Many different MOSFETs with distinct capabilities are available
        that fit this description. Determine the output requirements for
        your application and select the MOSFET accordingly.
*   2 x 6-pin header (100-mil centers)
*   4 x 2-position screw terminal block
    *   e.g. TE 1776493-2
    *   Or: 2 x 4-position screw terminal block
*   1 x 0.1ÂµF capacitor (0603)
